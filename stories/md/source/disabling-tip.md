Sometimes one wants to temporarily disable tips on a `<Source>`: for instance, when the user is engaging in a modal dragging session, one does not want tips to pop-out and disrupt the session. The `disabled` property can be used to prevent notes from showing or hiding on a `<Source>`.
Visible tips are hidden when the `disabled` is set.
