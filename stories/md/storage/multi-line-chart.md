`<Storage>` is used to manage tips on a multi-line chart. For each line, a tooltip lets the user track the exact coordinate of each point on a line. This story also shows how to use the `position.viewport` property to use different elements to constrain position adjustment, and not just the default element specified by `position.container`. In the story, the sticky notes associated to points on graphs use their graph as a viewport for flip adjustment; the sticky notes associated with graph metadata use the global container and do not use position adjustment.
